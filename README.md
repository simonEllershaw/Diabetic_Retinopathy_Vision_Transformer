# A Study of the Possible Advantages of VisionTransformers in the Automated Diagnosis ofDiabetic Retinopathy from Fundus Images

This is the repo used for my MRes dissertation. I am currently in the process of moving it from experimental spagetti code->usuable reproducible open science (it's a bit of a process so excuse the mess)

Of most interest at the moment is the results.ipynb notebook which reproduces all the data quoted in the results section of my thesis.

I'm off on vaction atm but when I get back I vow to finish this tidy up process!
